In 1980, an independent Canadian record label, Boiler Records, released a single on 7-inch vinyl. The artist, known as "Thunderfoot," was a collective of musician friends and singers, directed by Donald L. Schulz and Richard G. Bell. After a 45-year hiatus, Boiler Music Group is making a comeback, reviving the legacy of that long-forgotten label.
