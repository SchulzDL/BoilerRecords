One significant change is our new location. Boiler Records was originally founded in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Over the past forty years, I have undergone various career shifts, with the latest being in technology. This journey eventually brought me to Southern California, near Los Angeles. The new home for Boiler Music Group is now in the Los Angeles area.
