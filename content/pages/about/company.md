Mary and Donald had a discussion about the many projects that they both had in the backs of their minds and would like to make a reality.  They thought a corporation would be good in that it could provide a legal entity and a single structure in which they could register their copyrights and trademarks. It might even provide some tax relief and if things went really well, could very well represent a major part of their future.

Well these things are all well and good until you find that the vast array of projects are just that, vast, varied and hard to find a simple way to describe what their company "The Web We Weave, Inc." is all about. The common theme that still holds true in all their products and services is to **Improve your Quality of Life** which can be acomplished by working smarter and finding ways to automate or eliminate the redundant chores that we find ourselves doing. Giving more time back to you is our gift to you.
