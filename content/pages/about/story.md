The artists featured on this label are storytellers. While some artists excel at conveying emotions, our focus is on those who tell stories through their songs. This label caters to storytellers, echoing the early art of the songwriter. Much like the minstrels who traveled from town to town sharing tales of their journeys and experiences, our artists bring their stories to life through music. The albums are based on concepts and not just a collection of songs which are like situation comedies but instead like an 8 part mystery series and really giving some depth to the overall concept.
