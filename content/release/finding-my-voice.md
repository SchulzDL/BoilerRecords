In around 1967 things changed for me in a very big way. Up until this time I took music lessons and played music because my parents expected me to do so. They thought that playing an instrument or two would be a good skill to have. That year a grief so great that I had no words to express what I was feeling and I turned to music as my passion, my therapy, my way of expressing the grief that I was feeling from the loss of my youngest brother.

Not being able to express into words what I felt, kept some of what I was feeling hidden from others. I was able to control my anger by playing my music but also put me in a world of secrets. You could hear what I was going though if you were in tune what what I was espressing through my playing. I am sure that there was some anger in there as I did get a bit of a reputation as being a big wild. Too wild sometimes for the conservative church that we grew up in at that time.

Because I lacked the words to say what I was feeling, I would often find myself going with the flow and not shake things up, but holding it inside. After some fifty years, a marriage of twenty-four years, and extensive therapy, I am finally finding the words that I could not say back then. This album is my journey of finding my voice and the best way to experience this is to listen to it from the beginning to the end to get the full story.
