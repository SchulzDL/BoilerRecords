In around 1967 things changed for Donald in a very big way. Up until that time he took lessons and played music because his parents expected him to do so. They thought that playing an instrument or two would be a good skill to have. That year a grief so great that he had no words to express what he was feeling; turning to music as his passion, his therapy, his way of expressing the grief that he was feeling from the loss of a young brother.

Not being able to express into words what he felt, kept some of what he was feeling hidden from others. He was able to control his anger by playing music but this also put him in a world of secrets. You could hear what he was going though if you were in tune to what what he was espressing through his playing. We are sure that there was some anger in there as he did get a bit of a reputation as being a bit wild. Too wild sometimes for the conservative church that he grew up in at that time.

Because he lacked the words to say what he was feeling, he would often find himself going with the flow and not shake things up, but holding it inside. After some fifty years, a marriage of twenty-five years, and extensive therapy, he is finally finding the words that he could not say back then. This album is his journey of finding his voice and the best way to experience this is to listen to it from the beginning to the end to get the full story.
