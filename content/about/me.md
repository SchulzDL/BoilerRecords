Back in 1980 an independent Canadian Record label put out a single on 7 inch vinal under the name of Boiler Records. The artist went by the name of "Thunderfoot" which was a group of musician friends and singers that put this single together under the direction of Donald L. Schulz and Richard G. Bell. After a break of 45 years, Boiler Music Group is the come back story of that long forgotten Label.
