Here is a quick summary of how **The Donald Schulz Project** came to be. This version of myself started in 2023 when I bought a small MIDI keyboard to help with my transcribing tasks of music that I was writing. I was involved in the music industry back in the 70's and 80's but took a number of different directions and career paths. Back then, recording was expensive and hard to do. This keyboard opened the doors and windows as I realized that I could have a complete studio right here on my laptop.

This was a light bulb moment for me as I realized that a number of goals that I had came to be true with out much effort or that much thought. When I was in the industry, I had a goal to get to Los Angeles and always thought the music would get me there. Here I was in California, just outside of LA with the means to record living on 2.5 acres within city limits. It was a reocurring dream I had as a young teenager.
