This is the story of "The Donald Schulz Project" and how the artist discovered his voice through words and music. It began with a grief too overwhelming to comprehend at the age of eleven, where music became his refuge as he couldn't express his pain verbally. After fifty years, a marriage of twenty-four years and extensive therapy, he finally found the words he couldn't say back then. To fully experience this journey, listen to the album from beginning to end in the specified order.
